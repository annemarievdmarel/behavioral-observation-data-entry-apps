CyberTracker was designed by the CyberTracker Conservation Organisation in 1997 (http://cybertracker.org). 

The software is freely available and functions as a tool to create and design a mobile application which suits the needs of your study. Once the application has been designed it can be migrated to a mobile device (Android) for use. 

The setup is not as straight forward as the other apps we discussed but you have more freedom to design it. It took us about 6 hours testing and finalizing the app to do the behavioral observations of the horse video.
