# behavioral-observation-data-entry-apps

In this repository, we provide the set-up files and output files of 5 behavioral observation data entry applications. These applications allow observers to collect animal behavior data on a handheld computer (phone/tablet). 

The applications are 
  - Animal Behaviour Pro developed by Newton-Fisher (2012, 2020)
  - Animal Observer (Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund)
  - BORIS (Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software) by Friard & Gamba (2016) 
  - CyberTracker was designed by the CyberTracker Conservation Organisation (1997)
  - Prim8 Mobile (McDonald & Johnson, 2014)

To compare the learning curve, the workflow and the output for each of the applications, we selected a video of five horses of the Wild Discoveries program of the University of Florida (https://programs.ifas.ufl.edu/wild-discoveries/research-practice-materials/ accessed January 22, 2021). We then imported the individuals and ethogram to each of the applications and performed focal animal sampling. We added the set up files to the setup folder and included the output files in the output folder of each application. We hope that these files will be helpful to setup the application for your own needs.
